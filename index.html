                    <p>Iâ€™ve been thinking a lot about it, and I realized I probably made things worse by not talking. I just didnâ€™t know how to approach it, and I didnâ€™t want to make it even more uncomfortable. But I value our friendship, and I donâ€™t want this to be the thing that messes it up.</p>
                    <p>If youâ€™re up for it, Iâ€™d really like to talk and clear things up whenever you feel ready. Iâ€™m sorry for going quiet, and I just want to make sure everythingâ€™s good between us.</p>
